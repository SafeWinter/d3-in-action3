## 1.3 数据可视化最佳实践

Data visualization has never been so popular as it is today. The wealth of maps, charts, and complex representations of systems and datasets isn’t present only in the workplace, but also in our entertainment and our everyday lives. With this popularity comes a growing library of data visualizations, as well as aesthetic rules to promote legibility and comprehension. Your audience, whether the general public, academics, or decision makers, has grown accustomed to what we once considered incredibly abstract and complicated representations of trends in data. This makes libraries such as D3 popular not only among data scientists, but also with journalists, artists, scholars, IT professionals, and even data visualization enthusiasts.
数据可视化从未像今天这样流行。丰富的地图、图表以及系统和数据集的复杂表现形式不仅出现在工作场所，也出现在我们的娱乐和日常生活中。随着数据可视化的普及，数据可视化资料库以及提高可读性和理解力的美学规则也在不断增加。您的受众，无论是普通大众、学者还是决策者，都已经习惯了我们曾经认为非常抽象和复杂的数据趋势表现形式。这使得 D3 等库不仅受到数据科学家的欢迎，也受到记者、艺术家、学者、IT 专业人士甚至数据可视化爱好者的欢迎。

Such a wealth of options can seem overwhelming, and the relative ease of modifying a dataset to appear in a streamgraph, treemap, or histogram tends to promote the idea that information visualization is more about style than substance. Fortunately, well-established rules dictate which charts and methods to use for different data types. This book doesn’t aim at covering every best practice in data visualization, but we’ll touch on a few. Although developers use D3 to revolutionize the use of color and layout, most want to create visual representations of data that support practical concerns.
如此丰富的选项似乎让人应接不暇，而且修改数据集以在流图、树状图或直方图中显示相对容易，这往往会让人认为信息可视化更注重风格而非内容。值得庆幸的是，对于不同的数据类型，应该使用哪些图表和方法已经有了明确的规定。本书并不打算涵盖数据可视化的所有最佳实践，但我们会介绍其中的一些。虽然开发人员使用 D3 是为了彻底改变颜色和布局的使用，但大多数人还是希望创建支持实际问题的数据可视化表示。

As you build your first visualization projects and when in doubt, simplify—it’s often better to present a histogram than a violin plot, or a hierarchical network layout (like a dendrogram) than a force-directed one. The more visually complex methods of displaying data tend to inspire more excitement, but can also lead an audience to focus on the aesthetics of the graphics rather than the data. There’s nothing wrong with creating cool and jaw-dropping visualizations, but we should never forget that the primary goal of any data visualization is to tell a story. Asking around if people understand your visualization and how they interpret it is a crucial step. Do they need explanation? Which conclusions can they draw from interacting with your project? Does the story get told?
在您建立第一个可视化项目时，如果有疑问，请简化--通常情况下，展示直方图比展示小提琴图更好，展示分层网络布局（如树枝图）比展示力导向布局更好。视觉效果更复杂的数据展示方法往往能激发更多的兴奋点，但也会导致受众关注图形的美感而非数据。创造炫酷、令人瞠目的可视化效果无可厚非，但我们永远不应忘记，任何数据可视化的首要目标都是讲述一个故事。询问周围的人是否理解你的可视化，以及他们是如何解读它的，这是至关重要的一步。他们需要解释吗？他们能从与你的项目互动中得出什么结论？故事讲完了吗？

Still, to properly deploy information visualization, you should know what to do and what not to do. You need to have a firm understanding of your data and your audience. D3 grants us with immense flexibility, but as the saying goes, "With great power comes great responsibility." While it's good to know that certain charts are better suited to represent a specific type of data, it's even more important to remember that data visualizations can carry misinformation when not architected with care and from an informed perspective. If you plan to design your own visualizations, educating yourself on data visualization best practices is essential. The best way to learn this is to review the work of established designers and information visualization practitioners. Although an entire library of works deals with these issues, here are a few that we've found useful and can get you oriented on the basics. These are by no means the only texts for learning data visualization, but they are a great place to start.
不过，要正确部署信息可视化，你应该知道什么该做，什么不该做。你需要对数据和受众有充分的了解。D3 赋予我们极大的灵活性，但正所谓 "能力越大，责任越大"。知道某些图表更适合表现特定类型的数据固然是件好事，但更重要的是要记住，如果不从知情的角度精心设计，数据可视化可能会带来错误信息。如果你打算设计自己的可视化图表，那么了解数据可视化最佳实践是必不可少的。最好的学习方法就是查阅知名设计师和信息可视化从业者的作品。虽然整个图书馆都在讨论这些问题，但这里有几本我们认为很有用的书，可以让你掌握基础知识。这些绝不是学习数据可视化的唯一教材，但它们是一个很好的起点。

One thing to keep in mind while reading about data visualization is that the literature is often focused on static charts. With D3 you’ll be making interactive and dynamic visualizations. A few interactions can make a visualization not only more readable but significantly more engaging. Users who feel like they’re exploring rather than reading, even if only with a few mouse events, might find the content of the visualization more compelling and memorable than if they read the static equivalent. But this added complexity requires learning about user experience. We’ll get into this in more detail in chapter 7.
在阅读有关数据可视化的文章时，有一点需要牢记，那就是这些文章通常侧重于静态图表。有了 D3，您就可以制作交互式动态可视化。一些互动不仅能使可视化更具可读性，还能大大提高可视化的吸引力。用户如果觉得自己是在探索而不是阅读，即使只是通过几个鼠标事件，也可能会发现可视化的内容比阅读静态的内容更有吸引力，更令人难忘。但是，这种复杂性的增加需要学习用户体验。我们将在第 7 章详细介绍这一点。

This concludes our first chapter! Although we haven’t used D3 yet, you now have all the knowledge you need to get started. Keep coming back to this chapter when you are unsure about which SVG element you should use in your visualizations or if you need a reminder on how to manipulate data with JavaScript. From the next chapter, we wil roll our sleeves and create D3 visualizations.
第一章到此结束！虽然我们还没有使用过 D3，但你现在已经掌握了入门所需的全部知识。如果你不确定应该在可视化中使用哪种 SVG 元素，或者需要提醒你如何使用 JavaScript 操作数据，请继续阅读本章。从下章开始，我们将卷起袖子创建 D3 可视化。

> ##### Interview with Hesham Eissa and Lindsey Poulter, Data Visualization Designers and Developers 采访数据可视化设计师和开发人员 Hesham Eissa 和 Lindsey Poulter
>
> **In one of your blog posts, you wrote that, before the Ben & Jerry project, you both had experience designing data visualizations in Tableau. What made you want to learn D3 in addition to Tableau and instead of other data visualization tools?** (https://heshameissa.com/blog/learn-d3/)
> 你们在一篇博文中写道，在 Ben & Jerry 项目之前，你们都有在 Tableau 中设计数据可视化的经验。是什么原因让你们想学习 D3 而不是 Tableau 或其他数据可视化工具？( https://heshameissa.com/blog/learn-d3/)
>
> We both enjoyed the work we saw from [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/), [Nadieh Bremer](https://www.visualcinnamon.com/), the [Information is Beautiful Awards](https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/), and various news outlets producing data journalism pieces. We had taken note that D3 was the common thread behind all the work we enjoyed. Additionally, we both had a passion for finding creative ways to display data and didn’t want to be tied to the visualizations that a particular software allowed for. With D3, and web based visualizations in general, we felt that we could create anything we wanted. The only barrier was our own ability to make it!
> 我们都很喜欢我们看到的来自 The Pudding、Nadieh Bremer、"信息是美丽的 "奖以及各种新闻机构制作的数据新闻作品。我们注意到，D3 是我们喜欢的所有作品背后的共同点。此外，我们都热衷于寻找创造性的数据显示方式，不想被特定软件的可视化功能所束缚。有了 D3 和基于网络的可视化，我们觉得自己可以创造出任何想要的东西。唯一的障碍就是我们自己的制作能力！
>
> **About the same blog post, I love how you have structured your learning process, given that you had no prior experience with front-end development and that you had the patience to do it step by step. What did you find the hardest in this learning journey? What did you enjoy the most?
> 关于同一篇博文，我喜欢你是如何安排自己的学习过程的，因为你之前没有前端开发的经验，而且你有耐心一步一步地去做。在这个学习过程中，你觉得最难的是什么？你最喜欢什么？**
>
> The hardest part in the learning journey was that there were so many different parts to learn and understand. On top of that, the world of front-end development is changing so quickly, that we also had to learn how to keep up and get used to adapting examples from different versions. We sometimes found ourselves jumping ahead, so having patience to fully understand a concept before moving on was also difficult in its own way.
> 学习过程中最困难的部分是要学习和理解的内容太多。此外，前端开发的世界变化如此之快，我们还必须学会如何跟上变化，并习惯于调整不同版本的示例。我们有时会发现自己跳到了前面，因此，在继续学习之前耐心地充分理解一个概念也是很困难的。
>
> The most enjoyable part was when we finally reached the stage where we could directly apply our learnings to data visualization. Seeing our first SVG render on the page was a big moment of joy. As we dug into the different D3 modules, we thoroughly enjoyed understanding all the powerful ways each one could be used in the future. Modules like d3- force had so much flexibility and applicability and really expanded the way we thought about approaching data visualization.
> 最令人愉快的是，我们终于可以将所学直接应用于数据可视化。看到我们的第一张 SVG 渲染图出现在页面上，那一刻我们非常高兴。当我们深入研究不同的 D3 模块时，我们非常喜欢了解每个模块在未来可以使用的所有强大方法。像 d3- force 这样的模块具有极大的灵活性和适用性，真正拓展了我们对数据可视化的思考方式。

> **Where did you find help when you got stuck?
> 当你遇到困难时，你在哪里寻求帮助？**
>
> The best part about learning alongside someone else is having a built in partner to ask questions. If we didn’t understand a concept, we would ask each other. This either reaffirmed we both were confused and needed to spend more time on it or it allowed one person the opportunity to explain it in a completely different way.
> 与他人并肩学习的最大好处就是有一个可以提问的内置伙伴。如果我们不理解某个概念，就会互相询问。这要么再次证实我们都有困惑，需要花更多时间去研究，要么让一个人有机会用完全不同的方式来解释。
>
> Outside of each other, we spent a lot of time trying to understand other people in the field’s code or how they executed a specific concept. One of the best parts about the data visualization community is the willingness to share. [Mike Bostock’s examples on Observable](https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery?utm_source=d3js-org&utm_medium=hero&utm_campaign=try-observable), and the greater [Observable](https://observablehq.com/) community, were a lifesaver. Usually the first place we looked when creating a new chart was his examples. 99% of the time he had what we are looking for. [The Pudding](https://github.com/the-pudding) and [Nadieh Bremer](https://github.com/nbremer) had a lot of code on their respective GitHubs, so oftentimes we would say ‘how are they doing transitions?’ and find real working examples. Funny enough, we also bought the first edition of this book one weekend when we were confused about a concept and couldn’t find the answers online.
> 除了相互交流之外，我们还花了很多时间去理解其他业内人士的代码或他们是如何执行某个特定概念的。数据可视化社区最棒的一点就是乐于分享。迈克-博斯托克（Mike Bostock）在Observable和更大的Observable社区上提供的例子是我们的救星。通常，我们在创建一个新图表时，首先要看的就是他的示例。99% 的情况下，他都能提供我们想要的东西。布丁和纳迪埃-布雷默（Nadieh Bremer）在他们各自的 GitHub 上有很多代码，所以很多时候我们会说'他们是如何做转换的？有趣的是，我们还在一个周末买了这本书的第一版，当时我们对某个概念感到困惑，在网上又找不到答案。

> However, we will say there were definitely times where we really got stuck. Part of it was that our vocabulary wasn’t expansive enough yet to properly Google what we needed and part of it was that we were trying to find very niche things. We weren’t afraid to spend several days (or weeks) in a row just trying out whatever we could and experimenting. Ultimately, not having easy access to everything about web based data visualization really forced us to learn and understand (and not just copy and paste).
> 不过，我们也不得不说，有几次我们真的被卡住了。部分原因是我们的词汇量还不够丰富，无法正确地用谷歌搜索我们需要的东西，部分原因是我们试图找到非常小众的东西。我们不怕连续花几天（或几周）的时间去尝试任何东西。归根结底，由于无法轻松获得基于网络的数据可视化的所有信息，这确实迫使我们去学习和理解（而不仅仅是复制和粘贴）。
>
> Is there something you particularly like and/or dislike about D3.js, maybe compared to other data visualization tools?
> 与其他数据可视化工具相比，您对 D3.js 有什么特别喜欢和/或不喜欢的地方吗？
>
> D3 takes more time upfront to learn how to use. Instead of taking a few clicks to create a bar chart, it can sometimes take 50+ lines of code. However, ultimately that is what we love the most about D3... we can control *everything*!
> D3 需要更多时间来学习如何使用。创建一个条形图不需要点击几下，有时可能需要 50 多行代码。然而，这正是我们最喜欢 D3 的地方......我们可以控制一切！
