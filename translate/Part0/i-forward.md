# 序

In my capacity as a freelance data visualization educator, consultant, and designer, I’ve been deeply immersed in most corners of the data visualization world since the late 2000s and been fortunate to have a front-row seat to a huge amount of change. The technological landscape is always shifting. From the evolution of the tools of our trade to the platforms on which our work reaches its audience, there are always new forces pushing and pulling.
作为一名自由职业数据可视化教育工作者、咨询师和设计师，我从 2000 年代末开始就一直深深沉浸在数据可视化领域的各个角落，并有幸坐到前排亲眼目睹了巨大的产业变革。技术领域一直在变化。从我们行业工具的演变，到可视化作品可以触达受众的平台，总是不断有新生力量在向前推动，竞相角逐。

Where once this was a small, niche community of specialists, the elevated mainstream exposure of visualization led to substantial growth, both in the volume of enthusiastic participants and through the improved widening in their diversity. A field is only as rich as the breadth of its sensibilities and cultures, and the trajectory is hopeful. This expanding pool of talent continues to inject fresh thinking. Traditional discourse and so-called established convictions are being challenged. A heightened appetite for experimentation has led to innovative methods impacting audiences in novel ways. The boundaries of creative possibility are being stretched beyond just the chart and just the visual.
可视化曾是一个由专家组成的小众社区，但随着可视化在主流社会的曝光率提高，无论是热情的参与者数量还是参与者的多样性都有了大幅增长。一个领域的丰富程度取决于其情感和文化的广度，而这一发展轨迹令人充满希望。不断壮大的人才库持续注入新思维。传统话语和所谓的既定信念正在面临挑战。实验欲望的增强导致创新方法以新颖的方式影响观众。创意可能性的边界正在延伸，而不仅仅局限于图表和视觉。

What remains unchanged is a desire among data visualization designers and developers to attain maximum technical expressiveness and fluency. This is the ultimate capability. Expressiveness is having access to the broadest set of representation and presentation options. It’s being able to create more than—or at least as much as—you’re able to imagine. For many years, D3.js has been the JavaScript library that offers this.
依旧不变的，是数据可视化设计者和开发者都希望获得最大的技术表现力和流畅度。这是一种终极能力。表现力是指拥有最广泛的表现和展示选项。它能够创造出超过或者至少是你所能想象的东西。多年来，D3.js 一直是提供这种功能的 JavaScript 库。

Fluency is about accomplishing tasks that are too hard to do well by hand or too laborious to repeat by hand. Fluency minimizes the friction from not knowing how to perform certain technical tasks or from not knowing whether they’re even possible. Fluency is about having the discipline to know when and why you should and shouldn’t make certain choices.
流畅性就是要完成那些手工难以完成或手工重复太费力的任务。流畅性可以最大限度地减少因不知道如何完成某些技术任务或不知道是否可能完成这些任务而产生的阻力。流畅性就是要有纪律性，知道什么时候应该、为什么不应该做出某些选择。

This is where the third edition of D3.js in Action comes in. The previous editions skillfully presented readers with an understanding of what D3.js can do and how to do it. The third edition transcends these technical contents, addressing the when, why, and for whom, in the context of contemporary data visualization practices.
这就是《D3.js 实战》第三版的由来。前几版巧妙地向读者介绍了 D3.js 能做什么以及如何做。第三版超越了这些技术内容，以当代数据可视化实践为背景，探讨了何时使用、为何使用以及为谁所用的问题。

The most valuable books in any discipline tackle topics that have steep and, perhaps for some, overwhelming learning curves. They make those curves gentler and more surmountable. They work simultaneously as introductory texts for beginners and as sophisticated references for more advanced practitioners. They weave together the apparent objectivity of technology with the inherently subjective craft of visual communication. D3.js in Action delivers against these demands.
任何学科中最有价值的书籍所涉及的主题都有陡峭的学习曲线，也许对某些人来说是难以克服的。它们使这些曲线变得更柔和，更容易克服。它们既可作为初学者的入门读物，也可作为高级从业者的精深参考书。它们将技术的表面客观性与视觉传达的内在主观性巧妙地结合在一起。《D3.js in Action》满足了这些要求。

This is a book that is to be used. “In Action” reflects the applied nature of the teaching it delivers with relevant examples, valuable exercises, and inspiring case studies helping learners to take their learning from the page and put it into practice.
这是一本有用的书。“实战”体现了教学的应用性，通过相关实例、有价值的练习和鼓舞人心的案例研究，帮助学习者将书本上的知识付诸实践。 

This is a book that promotes being useful. The essence of doing things because you should, not because you could, is a persistent theme. You want to make functionally cool things? Of course. You wish to make aesthetically beautiful things? Who doesn’t? This book will satisfy those cravings but through the lens of what is right and what is relevant. Your results will be useful to the people they’re designed for.
这是一本提倡做有用之人的书。做事的本质是你应该做，而不是你可以做，这是一个永恒的主题。你想做出功能上很酷的东西吗？当然可以。你想做美观漂亮的东西？谁不想呢？这本书将满足你的这些愿望，但要从什么是正确的、什么是相关的角度出发。你的成果将对设计对象有所帮助。

The book is also about visualization that is usable. To design visualizations effectively is to create work that is responsive to the myriad platforms through which it may be consumed, elegantly adapting to different shapes, sizes, and feature compatibilities. To be usable, visualizations must also be equally accessible for all characteristics and abilities of the people using them. This text gives due importance to this oftenneglected topic.
本书还涉及可用的可视化。要有效地设计可视化作品，就必须创造出能够适应各种平台的作品，优雅地适应不同的形状、尺寸和功能。要使可视化作品可用，还必须让使用它们的人的所有特征和能力都能平等地使用。本书对这一经常被忽视的话题给予了应有的重视。

The foundations of this book, through its early editions, come from the vital work of Elijah Meeks, who has been a champion developer, a prominent promoter of community and better practices, and a thoughtful critic of data visualization practice from his real-world perspective developing data visualizations in industry.
Elijah Meeks 是一名优秀的开发者，是社区和更好实践的杰出推动者，也是一位深思熟虑的数据可视化实践批评家，他从自己在行业中开发数据可视化的实际视角出发，为本书的早期版本奠定了坚实的基础。

Anne-Marie Dufour is the perfect candidate to have taken on this new edition for the latest cohort of learners. She possesses that rare combination of being a highly accomplished data visualization developer and having a keen eye for design and instinct for creativity. Her substantial technical and communicative talents are perfectly supplemented by a natural flair for breaking down complex subjects into digestible and understandable parts. Anne-Marie’s own learning journey informs how she helps others, and there is no better person to take the wheel and drive you through this exciting subject.
安妮-玛丽-杜福尔（Anne-Marie Dufour）是为最新一届学员编写这一新版本的最佳人选。她既是一名成就卓著的数据可视化开发人员，又具有敏锐的设计眼光和创造力，是难得的人才组合。她拥有丰富的技术和沟通才能，并善于将复杂的主题分解成易于消化和理解的部分。安妮-玛丽自己的学习历程为她如何帮助他人提供了参考，没有比她更适合的人了。
