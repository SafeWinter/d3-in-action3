# 前言

Back in 2017, I was working as a frontend developer and found myself yearning for my next professional step. Although I enjoyed developing websites, something was missing. I was looking to bridge my background in engineering and my love for teaching with my new coding skills. That’s when my partner suggested I have a look at data visualization. For some reason, he thought I’d enjoy exploring this booming field. When I googled “data visualization,” I stumbled upon the project Data Sketches (www .datasketch.es) by Nadieh Bremer and Shirley Wu. Like so many others, I was deeply inspired and knew I had to learn how to build such projects. That's when I discovered a library called D3.js that they used to create their work.
早在 2017 年，我还是一名渴望迈出职业生涯下一步的前端开发者。虽然我很喜欢网站开发，但总觉得缺点什么。我希望将自己的工程背景和对教学的热爱与新的编程技能结合起来。就在这时，我的搭档建议我学习数据可视化。出于某种原因，他认为我会喜欢探索这个蓬勃发展的领域。当我在谷歌上检索“数据可视化”时，我偶然发现了纳迪埃·布雷默（Nadieh Bremer）和雪莉·吴（Shirley Wu）的“数据草图”项目（[www .datasketch.es](https://www.datasketch.es/)）。和许多人一样，我深受启发，知道自己必须学会如何构建这样的项目。就在那时，我发现了一个名为 D3.js 的库，他们就是用这个库来创建自己的作品的。

I started to learn D3 here and there, subscribing to courses and reading blog posts. But my frustration kept growing as I discovered that many of the code snippets I was learning were outdated. I was confused by the lack of a straightforward step-by-step approach to learning and building D3 projects. When the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic hit and the world went into shutdown, I finally had time to sit down and start building my first projects. Slowly, the philosophy behind D3 began to make sense and became more and more intuitive.
我开始在这里和那里学习 D3，订阅课程和阅读博文。但是，当发现自己学习的许多代码片段都已经过时时，我的挫败感与日俱增。我感到困惑的是，在学习和构建 D3 项目时，缺乏一种简单明了、循序渐进的方法。当第一波 COVID-19 大流行袭来时，世界进入了停摆状态，我终于有时间坐下来开始构建我的第一个项目。慢慢地，D3 背后的理念开始变得有意义，也变得越来越直观。

A while later, thanks to a kind nudge from Andy Kirk, I was contacted by Nicole Butterfield at Manning. She told me they were looking to build a course about D3 and asked if I’d be interested. With all the enthusiasm from my first dataviz projects, I jumped headfirst into that challenge and started to put together a strategy for learning D3. After a few months, Interactive Visualization with D3.js (http://mng.bz/jXrz) came to life.
过了一段时间，多亏了安迪·柯克（Andy Kirk）的善意提醒，曼宁公司的妮可·巴特菲尔德（Nicole Butterfield）联系了我。她告诉我他们想开设一门关于 D3 的课程，问我是否有兴趣。带着对第一个数据可视化项目的满腔热情，我一头扎进了这个挑战中，并开始制定学习 D3 的策略。几个月后，在线项目实操课程《用 D3.js 实现交互式可视化》（Interactive Visualization with D3.js, http://mng.bz/jXrz）诞生了。

While building this course with the second edition of D3.js in Action as a reference, my early frustrations came back. Much had changed with D3 since the book’s release, keeping us from using it to its full potential. In all my naiveté, I suggested to Nicole that I’d be willing to update the book and was lucky that Elijah and Manning allowed me to add my touch to this manuscript and bring my vision to life.
在以《D3.js 实战》第二版为参考构建本课程时，我早年的挫败感再次袭来。自从这本书发布以来，D3 发生了很多变化，使我们无法充分发挥它的潜力。我天真地向妮可建议，我愿意更新这本书，幸运的是，Elijah 和 Manning 允许我在书稿中加入我的想法，并将我的愿景变成现实。

With this new edition, I wish to provide you, the reader, with a road map toward creating unique and insightful data visualizations. This book and the projects it contains will help you learn the basics and the more advanced concepts, and I hope it will serve you as a reference for years to come.
通过这本新版本，我希望为读者提供一张通往创建独特而有洞察力的数据可视化的路线图。本书及其包含的项目将帮助你学习基础知识和更高级的概念，我希望它在未来的岁月里都能为你提供参考。
